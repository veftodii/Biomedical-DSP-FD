Informational system for ECG (electrocardiogram) digital signal processing in the frequency domain. It consists of a desktop application written in C# 4, which aims to analyze an ECG signal from an input file, represent it graphically, and try to detect the peaks and different types of arrhythmias on it.

This project is my bachelor's degree thesis at the Technical University of Moldova in 2012. Documents are in the Romanian language.

I started to study C# with this project and had 6 months to make it functional.
