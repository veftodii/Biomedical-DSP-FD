Informational system for ECG (electrocardiogram) digital signal processing in the frequency domain. It consists of a desktop application written in C# 4, which aims to analyze an ECG signal from an input file, represent it graphically, and try to detect the peaks and different types of arrhythmias on it.

This project is my university bachelor's degree thesis.
